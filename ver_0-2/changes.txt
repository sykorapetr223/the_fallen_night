rebulid the whole thing in cpp (cpp just better fr)
major changes to the rendering function
fixes for other functions
removed the highscore mechanism (dont plan on reintroducing it)

in the middle of working on 0-2 i started working on 0-3
so when some bugs in 0-2 came to my eyes i didnt pay attention to it much


TL;DR:
no highscore, bugs
